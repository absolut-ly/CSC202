# Summary
In this lab, you complete a partially written Java program that includes methods that require multiple parameters (arguments). The program prompts the user for two numeric values. Both values should be passed to methods named `calculateSum()`, `calculateDifference()`, and `calculateProduct()`. The methods compute the sum of the two values, the difference between the two values, and the product of the two values. Each method should perform the appropriate computation and display the results. The source code file provided for this lab includes the variable declarations and the input statements. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.

## Instructions
1. Write the Java statements as indicated by the comments.
2) Execute the program.
