# Summary
In this lab, you complete a partially written Java program that includes two methods that require a single parameter.

The program continuously prompts the user for an integer until the user enters 0. The program then passes the value to a method that computes the sum of all the whole numbers from 1 up to and including the entered number. Next, the program passes the value to another method that computes the product of all the whole numbers up to and including the entered number.

The source code file provided for this lab includes the necessary variable declarations and the input statement. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.

## Instructions
1. Ensure the file named SumAndProduct.java is open.
2) Write the Java statements as indicated by the comments.
3. Execute the program by clicking "Run Code."
