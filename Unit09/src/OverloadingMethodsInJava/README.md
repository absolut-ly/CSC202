# Summary
In this lab, you complete a partially written Java program that computes hotel guest rates at Cornwall’s Country Inn.

The program is described in Chapter 9, Exercise 11, in Programming Logic and Design. In this program, you should include two overloaded methods named `computeRate()`. One version accepts a number of days and calculates the rate at $99.99 per day.

The other accepts a number of days and a code for a meal plan. If the code is A, three meals per day are included, and the price is $169.00 per day. If the code is C, breakfast is included, and the price is $112.00 per day.

Each method returns the rate to the calling program where it is displayed. The main program asks the user for the number of days in a stay and whether meals should be included; then, based on the user’s response, the program either calls the first method or prompts for a meal plan code and calls the second method.

Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.

### Instructions
1. Open the source code file named Cornwall.java using the code editor.

2) Write the Java statements as indicated by the comments.

3. Execute the program by clicking "Run Code."
