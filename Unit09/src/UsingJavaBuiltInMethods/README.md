# Summary
In this lab, you complete a partially written Java program that includes built-in methods that convert characters stored in a character array to all uppercase or all lowercase.

The program prompts the user to enter nine characters. For each character in the array, you call the built- in methods `tolower()` and `toupper()`. Both of these methods return a character with the character changed to uppercase or lowercase. Here is an example:
```java
String sample = "This is a String.";
String result;
result = sample.toLowerCase();
result = sample.toUpperCase();
```
The source code file provided for this lab includes the necessary variable declarations and the necessary input and output statements. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.


### Instructions
1. Open the source code file named **ChangeCase.java** using the code editor.

2) Write the Java statements as indicated by the comments.

3. Execute the program with the following data:
