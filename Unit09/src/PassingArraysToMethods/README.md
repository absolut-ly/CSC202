# Summary
In this lab, you complete a partially written Java program that reverses the order of five numbers stored in an array.

The program should first print the five numbers stored in the array. Next, the program passes the array to a method where the numbers are reversed. The program then prints the reversed numbers in the main program.

The source code file provided for this lab includes the necessary variable declarations. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.

### Instructions
1. Ensure the file named Reverse.java is open.

2) Write the Java statements as indicated by the comments.

3. Execute the program by clicking "Run Code."
