Laramie Park District has files of participants in its summer and winter programs this year.
Each file is in participant ID number order and contains additional fields for first name,
last name, age, and class taken (for example, Beginning Swimming).

a. Design the logic for a program that merges the files for summer and winter programs to create
a list of the first and last names of all participants for the year in ID number order.

b. Modify the program so that if a participant has more than one record,
the participant's ID number and name are output only once.

c. Modify the program so that if a participant has more than one record, the ID number and name
are output only once along with a count of the total number of classes the participant has taken.
