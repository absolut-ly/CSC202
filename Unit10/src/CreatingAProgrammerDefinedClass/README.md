# Summary
In this lab, you will create a programmer-defined class and then use it in a Java program. The program should create two `Rectangle` objects and find their area and perimeter.

### Instructions
1. Make sure the class file named Rectangle.java is open.
2) In the `Rectangle` class, create two private attributes named `length` and `width`. Both `length` and `width` should be data type `double`.
3. Write public `set` methods to set the values for `length` and `width`.
4) Write public `get` methods to retrieve the values for `length` and `width`.
5. Write a public `calculateArea()` method and a public `calculatePerimeter()` method to calculate and return the area of the rectangle and the perimeter of the rectangle.
6) Open the file named **MyRectangleClassProgram.java**.
7. In the `MyRectangleClassProgram` class, create two `Rectangle` objects named `rectangle1` and `rectangle2`.
8) Set the `length` of `rectangle1` to **10.0** and the `width` to **5.0**. Set the `length` of `rectangle2` to **7.0** and the `width` to **3.0**.
9. Print the value of `rectangle1`’s perimeter and area, and then print the value of `rectangle2`’s perimeter and area.
10) Execute the program.
