# Summary
In this lab, you complete a Java program that uses an array to store data for the village of Marengo. The program is described in Chapter 8, Exercise 5, in Programming Logic and Design. The program should allow the user to enter each household size and determine the mean and median household size in Marengo. The program should output the mean and median household size in Marengo. The file provided for this lab contains the necessary variable declarations and input statements. You need to write the code that sorts the household sizes in ascending order using a bubble sort and then prints the mean and median household size in Marengo. Comments in the code tell you where to write your statements.

## Instructions
1. Ensure the file HouseholdSize.java is open.  
2) Write the bubble sort.  
3. Output the mean and median household size in Marengo.  
4) Execute the program by clicking the Run button and the bottom of the screen.  
5. Enter the following input, and ensure the output is correct.  
   Household sizes: `4, 1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4, 5, 6` followed by `999` to exit the program.
