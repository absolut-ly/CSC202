The Timely Talent Temporary Help Agency maintains an employee master file that contains
an employee ID number, last name, first name, address, and hourly rate for each temporary worker.
The file has been sorted in employee ID number order. Each week, a transaction file is created with
a job number, address, customer name, employee ID, and hours worked for every job filled by Timely Talent workers.
The transaction file is also sorted in employee ID order.

a. Design the logic for a program that matches the current week's transaction file records to the master file
and outputs one line for each transaction, indicating job number, employee ID number, hours worked, hourly rate, and gross pay.
Assume that each temporary worker works at most one job per week.
Output one line for each worker, even if the worker has completed no jobs during the current week.

b. Modify the help agency program to output lines only for workers who have completed at least one job during the current week.

c. Modify the help agency program so that any temporary worker can work any number of separate jobs during the week.
Output one line for each job that week.

d. Modify the help agency program so that it accumulates the worker's total pay for all jobs in a week and outputs one line per worker.
