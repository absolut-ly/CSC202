The Apgar Medical group keeps a patient file for each doctor in the office.
Each record contains the patient's first and last name, home address, and birth year.
The records are sorted in ascending birth year order. Two doctors, Dr. Best and Dr. Cushing, have formed a partnership.

1. Design the logic that produces a merged list of patients' names in ascending order by birth year.

2) Modify the program so that it does not display patients' names, but only produces a count of the number of patients born each year.
