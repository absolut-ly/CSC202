#Summary
In this lab, you will open the file, flowers.dat, and read input from that file in a pre written Java program.
The program should read and print the names of flowers and whether they are grown in shade or sun.

##Instructions
1) Make sure the source code file named Flowers.java is open.
2) Declare the variables you will need.
3) Write the Java statements that will open the input file, flowers.dat, for reading.
4) Write a while loop to read the input until EOF is reached.
5) In the body of the loop, print the name of each flower and where it can be grown (sun or shade) using a format of flowerName + " is grown in the " + sunOrShade).
6) Execute the program
